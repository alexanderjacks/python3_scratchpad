''' # Lab 11: Wall Painting
We're re-painting one wall of a room; let's figure out how much it's going to cost.
Assume one gallon of paint covers 400 square feet.

## Ask the user for:
1. width of the wall
2. height of the wall
3. how much a gallon of paint costs
Figure out then print how much it will cost to paint the wall with one coat.

## Advanced
- Also ask the user for how many coats they're going to put on, then calculate the cost of paint.
- Problem: you can only buy whole gallon cans of paint. Figure out a way to round up your wall calculation so you know how many whole gallons cans to buy.
- Allow the user to enter multiple walls' dimensions-- add the total areas together before calculating the cost.
